# GPA Calculator in Visual Basic.Net

The background of creating this simple GPA calculator application originated from the need of students to simulate GPA calculations based on their course grades. This calculator will read student data from an Excel file, making it easier for students to input their data in a common file format. GPA itself is calculated by comparing the total quality points obtained (the product of the grade weight and credit load) and the total number of credits taken.

The creation of this program utilizes several techniques, namely:

1. The VB.Net program will read an Excel file containing student grade data.
2. There are branching statements in the program that classify students' GPAs.
3. There are loops in the program to calculate the total number of credits and total quality points for each student by summing up each course row.
4. There are procedures or functions in the program to formulate GPA calculation and GPA categorization/classification.

The appearance of this GPA calculator application can be seen in the image below. The usage steps are as follows:

1. Enter the Excel data containing course information, grades, and so on. Each student's data is stored on a different sheet.
2. Next, select the Excel sheet to be calculated. This option allows you to choose which student's GPA will be calculated.
3. Then, click the "Calculate GPA" button. Your GPA result can be seen in the "GPA" box and the "GPA Category" box. The "GPA" box shows your GPA value, while the "GPA Category" box shows your GPA category.
4. You can change the sheet to select different students.
